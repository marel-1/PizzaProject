PizzaProject
📌 Overview

PizzaProject is a simple Windows Forms project made in C# by me. I created this a long time ago, before I learned many things about Windows Forms. This was my first project after learning how to use some buttons.

The project is a basic desktop application that demonstrates a pizza interface. It can be extended later to handle pizza orders or other functionality.
